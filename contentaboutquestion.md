hello，   <br>
 
After reading your report these days, very admired for your research work.  <br>
Could you help ask a lawyer for a few questions ? <br>
  <br>
a) Content from network that electromagnetic problems exist speculated people (they don't know, still affect others)and network computer etc <br>
 <br>
Is it possible that both speculated people and network computer could destroy technology and law  ,  when investigation,  detect experiment, protect experiment  etc  ? <br>
 <br>
b) is it better that speculated people be legally resolved first,   after that ,  the network computer problem still exist ?   <br>
 <br>
c) possibly， does the network computer require be solved with the help of a lawyer directly ?   
 <br>

 <br>
thanks <br>
comply with law？   <br>
