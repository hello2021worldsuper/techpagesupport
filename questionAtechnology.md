Hello，<br>
<br>
Someone said that there is an open source software, deepspeech, which could be as a translation software for recording, <br>
Open source software possible could be free after confirmation， <br>
<br>
If this kind of software is built at a site, the price cost lot money. <br>
Do you know someone need this kind of technology?  Could these solve your financial problem ?<br>
<br>
Please contact for information,<br>
There is a software workstation, could provide you technical support ？<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
thanks legal<br>
