Hello, what you see from the Internet about electronic equipment problems, electromagnetic perception and interference?

question——How to get clues and evidence ?  <br>
EEG equipment could record what hear and see, that is, what you hear and see, others could hear and see similar?  <br>
Please refer to https://www.pnas.org/content/112/44/E6058 <br>
 <br>
After recording real-time eeg events (similar to auditory events that you feel , others not hear),  <br>
then you see many irregular clues. Could you show this kind of evidence to the lawyer at real time? <br>
for example : After the sensation of AC sound appears, you see electronic equipment problems or network problems? <br>
Auditory eeg event show like this <br>

 then, the electronic equipment and network problems recorded at this time be counted as clue evidence? <br>
 <br>
  
question——What else does the brain-computer interface do? <br>
EEG reports could be obtained in a qualified workplace, <br>
1 Electromagnetic protection of brain-computer interface?  <br>

2 The evidence that BCI could provide is similar to brain health? Please refer to the litigation case <br>
3 Research about p300 polygraph? <br>
4 Trial examples of BCI software from the Internet, <br>

question——what department could help solve the problem? <br>
1 How could obtain legal assistance at litigation? <br>
2 Could lawyers get support for their work? <br>
3 How to investigate cases or other issues? <br>
4 Could you help contact the protection and technical laboratory? <br>

question——How to find technical help? <br>
There is a brain-computer interface work station, could provide technical support for eeg real-time detection? <br>

2 Obtain eeg or magnetoencephalogram data? <br>
